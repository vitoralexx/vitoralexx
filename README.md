- 👋 Hi, I’m @vitoralexx
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack web development, AI, robotics, electronics, fishing, trekking through nature like a lost hiker, biking until my legs question my life choices, doing absolutely nothing like a pro, cats & dogs (because why choose?), lifting things at the gym, binge-watching movies, and drinking coffee with Toddy like it’s a life philosophy. I like a bunch of other things too… but right now I forgot what they are. Classic.
- 💞️ I’m also studying Computer Science at UNISUL - Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina.
- ⚡ Recently, I landed my first internship as a software developer at the Prefeitura Municipal de São José.
